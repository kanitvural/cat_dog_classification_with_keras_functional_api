# Case Study: Cat vs. Dog Image Classification


![ss](screenshot.png)

### Project Description:
In this project, a deep learning model has been developed to classify whether an image is of a cat or a dog.

The Keras library's functional API has been used with a class-based structure to develop the CNN model from scratch.

### Dataset:
The dataset for the "Cat" and "Dog" classes has been downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data)


### Installation 


```
git clone https://github.com/kntvrl/cat_dog_classification_with_keras_functional_api.git

cd cat_dog_classification_with_keras_functional_api
python -m venv venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
